# discord-image-logger
Gathers info using discord's "Open Original" feature to steal cookies in order to get in side accounts like ROBLOX and discord

# Warning
It will show as a virus and the AntiVirus will remove it so you need to disable it or add it to a exclusion path

# Installation
It should be a simple run and function but if there is any problems report them in Issues and I will try to solve the problem

# Note
This is more barebones because I have no artistic quality.
